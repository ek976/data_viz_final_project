# data_viz_final_project

This project is in the format of a quarto website. The website can be viewed at: https://jbrismoreno.georgetown.domains/DSAN5200/_site/

To run the website locally, please do "quarto preview" (as it is a quarto website and needs a running server due to the interactivity of the plots).

All files for each separate plot have been kept along with the data cleaning procedures.

Structure:
- The structure of the site can be seen in the _quarto.yml file.
- Main site (index.qmd) has the information about the study.
- Authors.qmd has the information about the authorship.
- The code tab on the site brings you to this repo.

    "text": "Abstract\nIn this article we aim to explore gender inequality in education access across the globe. Education is one of the key drivers in the development of society. For that reason, we will be using data obtained from the World Bank to analyze the relationship between this gap and other factors such as GDP, GNI, population, and other variables. The data utilized is from the years 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014. We will focuss on a larger global scale and then dive down into specific regions in order to identify trends and patterns that are important to explore further through our analysis. Additionally, we will be looking at what regions have the highest diparity in education enrollment based on gender and what factors may be contributing to this disparity, whether they are economic, social, or political.\n\n\nIntroduction\nEducation is one of the most important factors in the development of society. Throughout all history, women have been marginalized in the education system. This has led to a significant gap in the education. The United Nations has recognized this issue and has emphasized the importance of education in the sustainable development of society. While this gender gap has been closing over the years, we will aim to explore the current state of this gap and what are the factors that may be contributing to its continued existence so that we can better understand how to address this issue.\nTo do this, we will not only take into account factors like global development or macroeconomics but we will try to dive deeper into gender roles in society. We will address six critical questions:\n\nHow do literacy rates correlate with population growth rates across different regions and time periods?\nHow does the allocation of resources to education influence literacy rates?\nIn what ways do literacy and education contribute to economic growth and development?\nTo what extent does gender equality manifest in educational access, participation, and outcomes?\nHow do trends in education mirror trends in employment, particularly regarding gender?\nWhat specific obstacles hinder gender equality in educational access, retention, and achievement?\n\nBy answering the above, we will be able to find out the importance of education in the development of countries and population, the influence it has within the working industry, what role economics plays in education, and explore further issues in the current gender gap. Hopefully, this study will help us better understand this gap and how to address it in the future.\n\n\nFemale Gross Enrollment Ratios by Region (2014)\nTo begin our analysis, we will be looking at different regions usually studied by global organizations like the World Bank. We will be focusing on the following regions: Arab World, East Asia & Pacific, Euro area, Europe & Central Asia, Heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC), Latin America & Caribbean (excluding high income), Middle East & North Africa, Middle East & North Africa (excluding high income), OECD members, and Sub-Saharan Africa (excluding high income). The objective is to visualize the differences in womenâ€™s enrollment at different education levels across the world at a global scale and identify any trends or patterns that may arise. This will also allow us to consider if some regions are worth exploring in more detail than others in our analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninitialData = [\n  {\"Country Name\":\"Arab

These region delimitations have been chosen from what global organizations like the World Bank utilize for their studies. You can select and deselect regions to focus on different regions, each bubble inside the region represents an education level, and the values inside are the female gross enrollment ration for 2014. The sizes of the bubbles correlate to the values. If levels of education are not present in a region is due to the lack of information about that specific combination of education level and region.\n\n\nFrom the chart above, not surprisingly, we can see that for all regions, the higher the education level, the lower the enrollment ratio. This is expected as the higher the education level, the more specialized and less accessible it becomes. However, we can see that there are some regions that have higher enrollment ratios than others. While looking at every regions data is important, it is worth noting that for some of them there is a lack of information for some education levels. This limits our ability to make a full comparison between regions. However, it still allows us to see the disparities between regions. Subsahaaran Africa, heavily indebted poor countries, and the Middle East and North Africa seem to have the lowest enrollment ratios across all education levels for female students. On the other hand, the Euro area, Europe and Central Asia, and OECD members have the highest enrollment ratios for female students.\nThis is important information to consider as we move forward with our analysis. One can think that it may be due to economic reasons, social and ideological reasons, or even political reasons. However, this problem has been present for decades and instead of taking assumptions to answer this question, we should identify the key reasons for this disparity and address it accordingly.\n\nEconomic influences on Female Access to Education\nThe World Bank assigns the worldâ€™s economies to four income groups, low income, lower-middle, upper-middle, and high income.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncome Category\nFY 2022\nFY 2023\nFY 2024\n\n\n\n\nLow Income\nâ‰¤ 1,045\nâ‰¤ 1,085\nâ‰¤ 1,135\n\n\nLower-middle\n1,046 - 4,095\n1,086 - 4,255\n1,136 - 4,465\n\n\nUpper-middle\n4,096 - 12,695\n4,256 - 13,205\n4,466 - 13,845\n\n\nHigh Income\nâ‰¥ 12,695\nâ‰¥ 13,205\nâ‰¥ 13,846\n\n\n\nThe classifications are updated each year on July 1 and are based on the GNI per capita of the previous year (2021). GNI measures are expressed in United States dollars (USD), and are determined using conversion factors derived according to the Atlas method (The Atlas method smooths exchange rate fluctuations using a three-year moving average, price-adjusted conversion factor. The USD estimate of GNI per capita is derived by applying the Atlas conversion factor to estimates measured in local currency units (LCU)).\n\n\n\nSources\nhttps://blogs.worldbank.org/en/opendata/new-world-bank-country-classifications-income-level-2022-2023"

for the year 2014. These region delimitations have been chosen from what global organizations like the World Bank utilize for their studies. You can select and deselect regions to focus on different regions, each bubble inside the region represents an education level, and the values inside are the female gross enrollment ration for 2014. The sizes of the bubbles correlate to the values. If levels of education are not present in a region is due to the lack of information about that specific combination of education level and region."

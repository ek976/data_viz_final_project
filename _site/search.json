Only the values collected by the World Bank are being displayed. Countries that did not share information do not display any values. Note that because of the way data is collected, small discrepancies in the reported age of children may occasionally cause net enrollment rates to exceed 100 percent by the World Bank. However, this allows us to visualize high vs low enrollment and contrast regions of interest."

    "text": "In this article we aim to explore gender inequality in education access across the globe. Education is one of the key drivers in the development of society. Using data obtained from the World Bank, our team analyzed the relationship between education attainment, gender, and other economic factors such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP), the Gross National Income (GNI) index, population, and other variables. The data utilized is from the years 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014. This project focuses on a larger global scale and then provides the interactivity for readers to dive into specific regions, countries, and demographics in order to identify trends and patterns. We hope that you find this dataset as interesting and expository as we did - from regions with the highest diparity in education enrollment based on gender to the linkage of other factors that may be contributing to this disparity encourages us to ask questions about the forces at play (economic, political, social) affecting women’s access to education and thus to a better life."

These region delimitations have been chosen from what global organizations like the World Bank utilize for their studies. You can select and deselect regions to focus on different regions, each bubble inside the region represents an education level, and the values inside are the female gross enrollment ration for 2014. The sizes of the bubbles correlate to the values. If levels of education are not present in a region is due to the lack of information about that specific combination of education level and region."

Only the values collected by the World Bank are being displayed. Countries that did not share information do not display any values. Note that because of the way data is collected, small discrepancies in the reported age of children may occasionally cause net enrollment rates to exceed 100 percent by the World Bank. However, this allows us to visualize high vs low enrollment and contrast regions of interest."

    "text": "Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is a standard metric to determine economic performance. Female literacy rate is also captured\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nLabor Force with Education Levels\nThe World Bank Data Catalog includes data about the proportion of males and females in the labor forces with advanced education and basic education. The proportion of high-income, low-income, lower middle income, and upper middle income countries is uneven in the bar plot below. High income countries reported the most labor statistics while low-income countries reported the least. In the high income category, over 40 countries reported these statistics. Although capturing data about female educational attainment is a priority for global development, only four low income countries reported labor statistics based on education level between 2010 and 2013. These four countries include Ethiopia, Madagascar, Mozambique, Uganda. The low income group represents the recent state of these four countries rather than the total of 26 low income countries classified by the World Bank.\n\n\n\nLabor-plot\n\n\nLabor force participation is an important statistic in assessing the progress for equal opporunity for women. For each income group, the proportion of males and females was captured for different levels of education, including basic education and advanced education. The proportion for each gender and education level was calculated with respect to the percentage of total labor forces participation for each gender. The countries were grouped by income group and the average labor percentage was calculated for each year.\nFrom 2010 to 2013, in high income countries, the proportion of male labor with advanced educaiton is above 80% while the proportion for female labor with the same education level is below 80%. The lower middle income countries showed the largest gap between female labor with advanced education and male labor, which was higher. For male and females labor with basic education, there are more males than females in the labor force. Interestingly, the gap between female labor and male labor is larger at the basic education level.\nSurprisingly, the “low income” group, which includes Ethiopia, Madagascar, Mozambique, Uganda, showed high proportions of female labor with basic and advanced education levels. According to the World Bank, “In many countries, enrollment in tertiary education slightly favors young women, however, better learning outcomes are not translating into better work and life outcomes for women. There is a large gender gap in labor force participation rates globally.” These findings suggest that reviewing overall labor force participation may begin the analysis of the recent progress in female education attainment. However, further research and more questions about different types of female labor can bring a better focus and attention to this developmental goal.\n\n\n\nLine-plot\n\n\nhttps://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/girlseducation"
